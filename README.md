Abstract:
Have you ever gone to a restaurant and waited thirty minutes for your order, even though it was an appetizer, only because there were ten people in front of you? In this fast paced world, especially in the life of a college student, where he/she only has 10 minutes to pick up coffee or a bite to eat, restaurants should prioritize queues according to a set of parameters, so that someone who order sides can get their order before someone who ordered the main course. Optiwait can reduce wait times for dine-in wait times as well. They could get on the waitlist from any kiosk situated around the city or their mobile phone app. The restaurant will be notified by the program if a customer is running late as well. OptiWait will also provide statistics on customer demographics, wait times and customer ratings.
